To help clinicians screen kidney transplant malfunction, designed a more accurate anomaly detection model for recipients.

<!-- Collected, cleaned, and preprocessed over 4 million EHR records from UNOS, the nation's organ transplant system.
Coined a local case-control (LCC) subsampling algorithm, enabled the selection of more balanced samples to make inferences, and trained and fine-tuned Logistic regression, LDA, Random Forest, and XGboost.
The best-performing logistic regression model, improved the recall by 15% compared with the traditional SMOTE sampling method, accelerated the inference procedure by over 50%, and saved ~$50K every year for the hospital.  -->
