To elevate the accuracy of AD diagnosis, built a multimodal binary classification system using brain imaging data obtained from ADNI, a longitudinal multicenter study.

<!-- Combined the patients' demographic and brain image features through kernel embedding; trained and optimized multiple classification models (Logistic regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGboost, LightGBM).
The best SVM model enhanced AD prediction accuracy by 50% over the baseline system and the recall to 95%, potentially enabling 2M patients every year in Canada to receive early treatments. -->
