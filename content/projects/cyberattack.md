To help the consulting firm effectively detect cyberattacks from large amounts (3 million) of Edge-IIoT network traffic records, discover underlying factors, and provide actionable safety suggestions.

<!-- Collaborated with the web development team to analyze user activities, engineer features, train and optimize multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, ), and apply SHAP for interpretability.
Deployed the best model on Microsoft Azure as a Web App using Docker and Flask, optimizing cloud resources to achieve a precision of 0.96 and recall of 0.95, resulting in annual cost savings of $100K . -->
